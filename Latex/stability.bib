	abstract = {Heinz Isler as the most famous contemporary shell designer has widely employed physical pre-modelling techniques for construction of many concrete shell structures. Through the physical approach to optimal form finding, Isler accomplished shell structures with robust performance. It would be interesting and beneficial to re-assess Isler’s shells, hence, this article attempts to study the structural performance of eight notable shells of Isler. Through reverse engineering and by the assistance of Rhino, MATLAB and Grasshopper, the precise geometry of Isler’s selected shells were modelled for the finite element analysis under their self-weight. The structural analysis was performed, with the parallel use of finite element software SAP2000 and Abaqus. The identical results of the two packages, further confirmed the accuracy of the analysis. The essential properties of various forms of the shells and their differences in behaviour were pinpointed and discussed within the calculations and the results were compared with the data of the genuine published references on Isler’s works. The internal forces, the amount of von Mises stresses, support reactions and the buckling loads of the shells are explored. The analyses revealed that, despite of their major membrane action, all the shells had negligible amount of bending moments, especially near the supports. However, in general, all the shells exhibited an appropriate performance under the applied actions. But, at the same time, they exhibited different buckling behaviour as a probable source of instability in them.},

	abstract = {Reinforced concrete shells frequently constitute the most visible element of a building envelope. They dominate the architectural expression, yet the threedimensional form is generally determined by the engineer according to its structural efﬁciency, rather than by the architect according to aesthetical considerations. This raises the question ‘‘Who is the author of the design?’’ The design philosophy of recognised shell designers is introduced, speciﬁcally that of Swiss shell designer and ‘‘structural artist’’ Heinz Isler, who is considered to have had particular sensitivity to the aesthetics of his shells, rooted in his admiration of the natural world and derived by natural laws. The Sicli Factory shell, 1968, is taken as a case study and is used to compare Isler’s design method with contemporary digital form-ﬁnding using the particle spring method. It is concluded that there are advantages and disadvantages to both physical and digital modelling methods. Designers should be encouraged to explore with various approaches.},

	abstract = {Best known for his free-form shell structures, Heinz Isler has inspired both architects and engineers with his creations. His work transcends the definition of mere structural engineering to the extent of becoming structural art. This book considers the unique work of this engineer.Isler's primary medium of expression is the reinforced concrete shell. Rejecting the use of mathematical formulae, he approaches the challenges of each new structure by using physical modelling to determine the form and subsequently to investigate its stability. Harmonious, natural and inspiring structures are the result. Isler's sensitivity for the natural world is expressed in the quiet beauty of the shell forms that he has designed, which merge more easily into the landscape than most modern buildings. He creates structures of high efficiency with the lowest possible environmental impact.The author takes a look at Isler's major works, at the philosophy behind these works and at Isler's methods.},
